# RL Agents Library
A mini RL library implementing RL learners on OpenAI environments.

Environments supported: `CartPole`.

Learners supported: `DQN`, `DDQN`.

Examples can be found in `usage_example.ipynb`. I'm running this successfully on Python 3.10.8.

#### Sample Usage

```
python3 -m venv rl_testing
source rl_testing/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/baubels/reinforcement_learners.git
cd reinforcement_learners
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
